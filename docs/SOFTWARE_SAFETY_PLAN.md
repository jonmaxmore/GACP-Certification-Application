# GACP Software Safety Plan
## IEC 62304 Compliance Document

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-03  
**Classification:** Class B (May cause non-serious injury)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the software development lifecycle processes and safety requirements for the GACP (Good Agricultural and Collection Practices) Certification System, in accordance with IEC 62304:2006/AMD1:2015.

---

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Purpose
The GACP Certification System manages the certification process for medicinal plant production in Thailand, issued by the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine (DTAM).

### 2.2 Safety Classification Rationale

| Factor | Assessment | Result |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Direct patient care | No | - |
| Diagnostic data | No | - |
| Certificate validity | Yes (consumer safety) | Risk |
| Data integrity | Critical (legal documents) | Risk |

**Conclusion:** Class B - Software whose failure could result in non-serious injury through improper certification of medicinal plants.
